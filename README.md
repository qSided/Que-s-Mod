Que's (my) mod adds a (currently incomplete) learn-by skill system and a (soon to come) class system inspired by old-style RPGs. Intended to be an all-in-one RPG package deal, Que's Mod plans to add lots of new content aside from the classes and skills as well.
Right-alt by default to open the skills screen.
